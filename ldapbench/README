LDAPBench is a benchmark utility for measuring LDAP directory server performance. This project (written in C) is based on, and 
offers most of the features of Mindcraft's DirectoryMark (http://www.mindcraft.com/directorymark/) product. The distinction is that 
LDAPBench offers the ability to use multiple SDKs (Mozilla and OpenLDAP). This allows for more accurate benchmarking tailored to the 
specific server's environment.

Benchmarks have been performed for ldap, ldaps, and ldapi transports and have been tested against iPlanet and OpenLDAP 
installations. Currently, only search operations are supported for benchmarking read throughput. One of the goals of this project 
was to get assistance with adding tests for modify, add, delete, compare, and modrdn operations. The primary goal is to offer a 
free, open source distribution used as a reliable and extensible alternative for LDAP benchmarking.

NOTE: Most of this code was written in 1999-2000 and tested extensively with OpenLDAP and NDS/ODS (Netscape Directory Server).
Work does need to be done to get it current with latest releases and LDAP protocol updates, however it should be minimal.
